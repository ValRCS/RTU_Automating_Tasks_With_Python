The Choice (Messy Version)
The intellect of man is forced to choose!!!!
Perfection of,,,,,,, the life, or of,,,,,, the work,,,,
And if it take the second must refuse
A heavenly mansion, raging in the dark????
    When all that story’s finished, what’s the news?
In luck or out the toil has left its MARK:::::
Or the day’s vanity, the night’s remorse!!!!
